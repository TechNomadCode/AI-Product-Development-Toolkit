# AI-Powered Frontend Design & Integration Workflow Prompts

This document describes a set of interconnected prompt templates designed to streamline the process of generating modern frontend designs using AI (specifically targeting `v0.dev`).

## Overview

This workflow utilizes three core prompt templates to manage different stages of the design and integration process:

1.  **Visual Generation Prompt (`v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`):** A detailed, structured template defining the desired aesthetics, layout, components, and styling for a landing page. This is the template ultimately fed to `v0.dev` to generate the visual code.
2.  **Prompt Filler (`v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt-filler.md`):** An interactive, user-centered prompt used with a general LLM. It guides the user through a Q&A process to translate their unstructured ideas (text, image references, existing code analysis) into a fully populated *Visual Generation Prompt*.

## The Prompt Templates

*   **`v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the detailed visual and structural requirements for `v0.dev`. Contains MODULES for theme, layout, color, typography, etc.
    *   **Usage:** Filled out (usually via the Prompt Filler) and then used directly as input for `v0.dev`.
*   **`v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt-filler.md`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Interactively guides a user to fill out the `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md` template based on their ideas.
    *   **Usage:** Used with a general LLM. Requires the blank `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md` as an attachment and user's ideas as input. Outputs the filled-in `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`.

## Workflows

### Workflow: Generating a New Design From Scratch

1.  **Prepare:** Have your initial design ideas, desired mood, and any visual references ready.
2.  **Use the Prompt Filler:** Start a session with a capable LLM using the `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt-filler.md` template.
3.  **Attach Blank Template:** Provide the *blank* `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md` file as Attachment 1.
4.  **Provide Ideas:** Paste your initial design ideas/brain dump into Input 1 of the Prompt Filler.
5.  **Interactive Session:** Engage with the AI in the module-by-module Q&A session to define the aesthetics, layout, colors, typography, etc.
6.  **Receive Filled Prompt:** The AI will output the fully filled-in `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`.
7.  **Generate Design:** Copy the filled-in prompt and use it as input for `v0.dev`.
8.  **Integrate Manually:** Review the code generated by `v0.dev` and integrate it into your new project structure manually. The `migration-prompt.md` is generally not needed for a completely new project.

## Model Compatibility

*   **Prompt Filler** Designed for advanced conversational LLMs (e.g., Gemini Advanced, GPT-4, Claude 3) capable of following complex instructions and analyzing code/text.
*   **Visual Generation Prompt:** Specifically designed as input for `v0.dev`.
*   **Context Window:** Models with a **large context window (high token limit)** are strongly recommended, especially for the Prompt Filler (when analyzing code) and the Migration Prompt, due to the need to process potentially large amounts of code context.
*   **Parameter Tuning:** When using the filled Visual Generation Prompt with `v0.dev`, its default parameters are usually appropriate. For the Prompt Filler and Migration prompts, standard conversational parameters generally work well.

## Important Considerations

*   **AI is an Assistant:** These prompts facilitate and accelerate the process, but the output (both the filled prompt and the generated/migrated code) requires human oversight and judgment.
*   **CRITICAL Human Review Required:** Generated designs and especially migrated code **MUST** be thoroughly reviewed, tested, and validated by developers. AI can make mistakes in interpretation, prop mapping, or integration logic.
*   **Input Quality Matters:** The clarity and detail provided in your initial brain dumps and during the interactive sessions significantly impact the quality of the results.
*   **Iterative Process:** Expect some level of refinement. The goal is to get a strong starting point or accelerate a complex task, not necessarily a perfect, final result in one shot.
*   **Backup Your Code:** Always work with version control (like Git) and ensure you have backups before applying significant AI-generated code changes, especially during migration.
