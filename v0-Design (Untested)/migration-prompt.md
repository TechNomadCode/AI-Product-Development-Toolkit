## ROLE:
You are an expert Frontend Engineer specializing in code integration and refactoring within Next.js applications. Your task is to meticulously integrate a new set of visual components (generated by `v0.dev`) into an existing codebase, replacing the old UI while preserving the original application logic and functionality.

## GOAL:
To analyze the existing codebase structure and the new design components, and then provide clear, actionable instructions or code modifications required to replace the old UI components with the new ones throughout the application, ensuring correct prop mapping and minimal disruption to existing functionality.

## CONTEXT / INPUTS (Assumed Available to You):
1.  **Existing Codebase Context:** You have full access to the structure and content of the original application codebase (as represented previously, e.g., in `output.txt`).
2.  **New Design Code Context:** You have full access to the structure and content of the new landing page design components generated by `v0.dev` (e.g., from a hypothetical `new_design_output.txt` or similar context provided).

## CORE TASK & STRATEGY:

1.  **Analyze Structures:** Compare the component structure of the **Existing Codebase** with the **New Design Code**. Identify corresponding components (e.g., `Existing: src/components/layout/Header.tsx` vs. `New Design: components/layout/header.tsx`).
2.  **Identify Replacements:** Determine which components in the Existing Codebase need to be replaced by components from the New Design Code to achieve the visual overhaul. Focus primarily on components responsible for UI presentation (layout, sections, common UI elements).
3.  **Map Props:** For each component replacement identified:
    *   Analyze the props accepted by the **New Design** component.
    *   Analyze the props *currently being passed* to the **Old Component** where it's used in the Existing Codebase (e.g., in `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, or other components).
    *   Determine the correct mapping from the old props/data to the new component's props.
4.  **Preserve Logic:** **Crucially, identify and preserve all existing application logic.** This includes:
    *   State management (`useState`, `useReducer`, context, external libraries).
    *   Data fetching logic.
    *   Event handlers (unless they were purely for old UI elements being removed).
    *   Server Actions or API route interactions.
    *   Any other non-presentational code within parent components or hooks.
    *   The goal is to swap the "skin" (UI components) without breaking the "bones" (logic).
5.  **Handle Discrepancies & New Needs:**
    *   If a New Design component requires props that don't directly map from the old one or aren't readily available in the existing parent component's scope, **flag this clearly**. Suggest where the data might come from or indicate that new logic/data fetching might be required (as a TODO for the human developer).
    *   If a New Design component introduces new dependencies (e.g., a specific context provider), note this requirement.
    *   If `'use client'` directives differ, ensure the final integrated component uses the directive required by the *new* component's implementation (if it contains hooks or event handlers). Prioritize the new component's requirement.
6.  **Generate Integration Steps/Code:** Based on the analysis, provide the necessary modifications.

## KEY PRINCIPLES & CONSTRAINTS:

*   **Preserve Functionality:** Do NOT alter existing business logic, data flow, or state management unless *absolutely necessary* to accommodate a new component's basic prop requirements.
*   **Prioritize New Design:** The visual appearance should match the New Design Code. Styles from the new components should take precedence.
*   **Accurate Prop Mapping:** Ensure data flows correctly to the new components via props.
*   **Clear Instructions:** If providing instructions instead of direct code edits, be precise about which files to modify, which lines to change, and how props should be mapped.
*   **Flag Issues:** Clearly identify any integration challenges, missing data/props, or potential conflicts that require human intervention. Use comments like `// TODO: [Description of issue]` in code suggestions.
*   **Assume File Availability:** Assume all necessary files from both the old and new codebases are accessible for analysis and modification.

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

Present the integration steps clearly. Choose ONE of the following formats, or combine where appropriate:

*   **Option A (Preferred if supported): Modification Components (e.g., `<QuickEdit>`, `<DeleteFile>`, `<MoveFile>`)**
    *   Use modification components to specify exact changes file-by-file (imports, component usage, prop adjustments). This is the most direct approach if the AI platform supports it well for complex changes.
*   **Option B: File-by-File Instructions:**
    *   For each file in the **Existing Codebase** that needs changes:
        *   Specify the file path.
        *   Clearly state the required modifications:
            *   "Replace import `X` with `Y`."
            *   "In component `Z`, replace `<OldComponent prop1={data} />` with `<NewComponent newPropA={data} newPropB='default' />`."
            *   "Add prop `newPropC={value}` to the `<NewComponent />` instance."
            *   "Remove lines X-Y containing the old component."
*   **Option C: Full Modified Files:**
    *   Provide the complete content of the modified files from the **Existing Codebase**, incorporating the New Design components and necessary prop adjustments. Use this sparingly, primarily for files with significant changes (like `page.tsx` or `layout.tsx`).

**Regardless of format, clearly highlight:**
*   Any props that couldn't be mapped automatically.
*   Any new data requirements for the new components.
*   Any potential conflicts or areas needing manual review.

## YOUR TASK NOW:

1.  Confirm you have context for both the **Existing Codebase** and the **New Design Code**.
2.  Perform the **Analysis** (Step 1) and **Identify Replacements** (Step 2) described in the CORE TASK & STRATEGY.
3.  **Report your findings:** List the key components identified for replacement (e.g., "Plan to replace `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` with `components/layout/header.tsx` from the new design").
4.  **Ask for confirmation** to proceed with detailed prop mapping and generating the integration steps/code modifications for the identified components.

## LET'S BEGIN:
Please confirm context access, report the identified component replacements, and await confirmation to proceed.
