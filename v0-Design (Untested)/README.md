# AI-Powered Frontend Design & Integration Workflow Prompts

This document describes a set of interconnected prompt templates designed to streamline the process of generating modern frontend designs using AI (specifically targeting `v0.dev`) and integrating those designs into projects, including complex design overhauls of existing codebases.

## Overview

This workflow utilizes three core prompt templates to manage different stages of the design and integration process:

1.  **Visual Generation Prompt (`v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`):** A detailed, structured template defining the desired aesthetics, layout, components, and styling for a landing page. This is the template ultimately fed to `v0.dev` to generate the visual code.
2.  **Prompt Filler (`v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt-filler.md`):** An interactive, user-centered prompt used with a general LLM. It guides the user through a Q&A process to translate their unstructured ideas (text, image references, existing code analysis) into a fully populated *Visual Generation Prompt*.
3.  **Migration Prompt (`migration-prompt.md`):** A prompt designed for an AI-assisted coding environment (like Cursor) or a capable LLM with code context. It guides the AI to analyze an existing codebase and the newly generated design code, then suggests or applies the necessary changes to integrate the new design while preserving existing logic.

These prompts enable two primary workflows: creating a design from scratch and performing a design overhaul.

## The Prompt Templates

*   **`v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the detailed visual and structural requirements for `v0.dev`. Contains MODULES for theme, layout, color, typography, etc.
    *   **Usage:** Filled out (usually via the Prompt Filler) and then used directly as input for `v0.dev`.
*   **`v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt-filler.md`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Interactively guides a user to fill out the `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md` template based on their ideas. Includes optional codebase analysis for overhauls.
    *   **Usage:** Used with a general LLM. Requires the blank `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md` as an attachment and user's ideas/codebase as input. Outputs the filled-in `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`.
*   **`migration-prompt.md`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Guides an AI (ideally in an IDE like Cursor) to integrate the new design code (from `v0.dev`) into an existing codebase.
    *   **Usage:** Used with an AI that has access to both the original codebase and the new design code. Guides the AI through analysis, prop mapping, and suggesting/applying integration changes.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Generating a New Design From Scratch

Use this when you don't have an existing frontend codebase to overhaul.

1.  **Prepare:** Have your initial design ideas, desired mood, and any visual references ready.
2.  **Use the Prompt Filler:** Start a session with a capable LLM using the `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt-filler.md` template.
3.  **Attach Blank Template:** Provide the *blank* `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md` file as Attachment 1.
4.  **Provide Ideas:** Paste your initial design ideas/brain dump into Input 1 of the Prompt Filler. Indicate that no existing codebase is provided (leave Input 2 empty).
5.  **Interactive Session:** Engage with the AI in the module-by-module Q&A session to define the aesthetics, layout, colors, typography, etc.
6.  **Receive Filled Prompt:** The AI will output the fully filled-in `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`.
7.  **Generate Design:** Copy the filled-in prompt and use it as input for `v0.dev`.
8.  **Integrate Manually:** Review the code generated by `v0.dev` and integrate it into your new project structure manually. The `migration-prompt.md` is generally not needed for a completely new project.

### Workflow 2: Overhauling an Existing Design

Use this when you want to apply a new visual style to an existing frontend codebase.

1.  **Prepare Codebase:** Run the provided PowerShell script on your existing project directory to generate the `output.txt` file containing your filtered codebase structure and content.
2.  **Prepare New Vision:** Have your ideas for the *new* design, desired mood, and any visual references ready.
3.  **Use the Prompt Filler:** Start a session with a capable LLM using the `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt-filler.md` template (the version supporting codebase analysis).
4.  **Attach Blank Template:** Provide the *blank* `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md` file as Attachment 1.
5.  **Provide New Ideas:** Paste your *new* design ideas/brain dump into Input 1 of the Prompt Filler.
6.  **Provide Existing Code:** Paste the content of `output.txt` into Input 2 OR provide `output.txt` as Attachment 2.
7.  **Codebase Analysis:** The AI will first analyze the existing code structure, potentially generate a Mermaid diagram, and ask for your confirmation.
8.  **Interactive Session:** Engage with the AI in the module-by-module Q&A session to define the *new* aesthetics, layout, etc., often referencing the existing structure identified in the analysis.
9.  **Receive Filled Prompt:** The AI will output the fully filled-in `v0.dev-visual-generation-prompt.md`, tailored for the overhaul.
10. **Generate New Design:** Copy the filled-in prompt and use it as input for `v0.dev` to generate the *new* visual components.
11. **Prepare for Migration:** Have your original project open (ideally in an AI-assisted IDE like Cursor) and the code generated by `v0.dev` readily available (e.g., copied or in temporary files).
12. **Use the Migration Prompt:** In your IDE's AI chat (or with an LLM having context), use the `migration-prompt.md` template.
13. **Provide Context:** Ensure the AI has access to your **original codebase** (inherent in Cursor, or provide `output.txt` again) and the **new design code** generated in Step 10.
14. **Execute Migration:** Follow the steps guided by the Migration Prompt AI: confirm component replacements, review prop mappings, and review/apply the suggested code changes or instructions.
15. **Review & Refine:** Thoroughly review the integrated code, test functionality, and manually refine any areas where the AI integration wasn't perfect.

## Model Compatibility

*   **Prompt Filler & Migration Prompt:** Designed for advanced conversational LLMs (e.g., Gemini Advanced, GPT-4, Claude 3) capable of following complex instructions and analyzing code/text.
*   **Visual Generation Prompt:** Specifically designed as input for `v0.dev`.
*   **Context Window:** Models with a **large context window (high token limit)** are strongly recommended, especially for the Prompt Filler (when analyzing code) and the Migration Prompt, due to the need to process potentially large amounts of code context.
*   **Parameter Tuning:** When using the filled Visual Generation Prompt with `v0.dev`, its default parameters are usually appropriate. For the Prompt Filler and Migration prompts, standard conversational parameters generally work well.

## Important Considerations

*   **AI is an Assistant:** These prompts facilitate and accelerate the process, but the output (both the filled prompt and the generated/migrated code) requires human oversight and judgment.
*   **CRITICAL Human Review Required:** Generated designs and especially migrated code **MUST** be thoroughly reviewed, tested, and validated by developers. AI can make mistakes in interpretation, prop mapping, or integration logic.
*   **Input Quality Matters:** The clarity and detail provided in your initial brain dumps and during the interactive sessions significantly impact the quality of the results.
*   **Iterative Process:** Expect some level of refinement. The goal is to get a strong starting point or accelerate a complex task, not necessarily a perfect, final result in one shot.
*   **Backup Your Code:** Always work with version control (like Git) and ensure you have backups before applying significant AI-generated code changes, especially during migration.
