## About This Repository

As I use different AI tools I often find myself designing specific prompts to get desired outputs. This repository is my way of:

*   **Organizing:** Keeping track of prompts that work well.
*   **Reusing:** Quickly finding and adapting prompts for new tasks.
*   **Sharing:** Making useful prompts available (primarily for myself, but maybe helpful to others!).
*   **Learning:** Refining prompts over time and seeing patterns in what works.

## Repository Navigation

This repository is organized into topical folders containing specialized prompts:

* **PRD**: Templates for creating comprehensive Product Requirements Documents through guided questioning.
* **MVP**: Templates for developing structured Minimum Viable Product plans that align with product vision.
* **Ultra-Lean-MVP**: Template focused on rapidly defining core MVP build specifications.
* **Testing**: Templates for creating thorough test plans for software quality assurance.

## How to Use

1.  **Browse:** Navigate through the repo to find a relevant prompt (template).
2.  **Copy:** Open the relevant file (often `.md` or `.txt`) and copy the prompt text.
3.  **Adapt:** Paste the prompt into your chosen AI tool. **Remember to replace any placeholders** (like `[your topic]`, `[specific detail]`, `[desired tone]`, etc.) with your specific requirements.
4.  **Experiment:** AI responses can vary. Feel free to tweak the prompt further based on the results you get.

## How I designed these

I use AI tools for prompt design combined with my personal [Prompt Rulebook](https://promptquick.ai) and all the aquired metaknowledge throughout my journey of study and engineering.
