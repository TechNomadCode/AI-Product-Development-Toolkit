# Nomad's AI Prompt Library üß† [PromptQuick.ai](https://promptquick.ai)

Welcome to my personal collection of AI prompt templates and useful prompts! This repository serves as a central place to store, organize, and share effective prompts for various AI models.

## About This Repository

As I use different AI tools I often find myself designing specific prompts to get desired outputs. This repository is my way of:

*   **Organizing:** Keeping track of prompts that work well.
*   **Reusing:** Quickly finding and adapting prompts for new tasks.
*   **Sharing:** Making useful prompts available (primarily for myself, but maybe helpful to others!).
*   **Learning:** Refining prompts over time and seeing patterns in what works.

## Guided Conversational Approach

What makes these prompts unique is their **user-centered, guided conversational design**:

* **Interactive Process:** Rather than one-shot prompting, these templates guide AI models through an iterative conversation with you.
* **Structured Questioning:** The AI asks targeted questions focused on specific aspects of your project, building a comprehensive document piece by piece.
* **User Confirmation Checkpoints:** The prompts explicitly instruct the AI to verify its understanding and direction with you before moving to new sections or making significant interpretations.
* **Contextual Analysis:** Many templates use dual inputs (like a PRD for context plus an MVP concept), instructing the AI to cross-reference information for consistency.
* **Adaptive Guidance:** The templates help you think through aspects you might have missed, while allowing you to maintain control over the final direction.

This approach combines the best of both worlds: AI's ability to provide structure and ask clarifying questions, with your subject matter expertise and decision-making authority.

## Repository Navigation

This repository is organized into topical folders containing specialized prompts:

* **PRD**: Template for creating comprehensive Product Requirements Documents through guided questioning.
* **MVP**: Template for developing structured Minimum Viable Product plans that align with product vision.
* **Ultra-Lean-MVP**: Template focused on rapidly defining core MVP build specifications.
* **Testing**: Template for creating thorough test plans for software quality assurance.
* **v0 Design**: Templates for modern frontend designs using `v0.dev`.

## How to Use

1.  **Browse:** Navigate through the repo to find a relevant prompt (template).
2.  **Copy:** Open the relevant file (often `.md` or `.txt`) and copy the prompt text.
3.  **Adapt:** Paste the prompt into your chosen AI tool. **Remember to replace any placeholders** (like `[your topic]`, `[specific detail]`, etc.) with your specific requirements.
4.  **Engage in the Conversation:** Unlike simple one-shot prompts, these templates create a structured dialogue. Answer the AI's questions thoughtfully, as your responses guide the entire process.
5.  **Confirm Checkpoints:** Pay attention when the AI verifies its understanding or direction - these confirmation points are designed to keep the output aligned with your vision.
6.  **Iterate to Completion:** Continue the conversation until sufficient information has been gathered, at which point the AI will offer to compile the collected information into a structured draft document.

## Model Compatibility

These prompts were developed with large context window models in mind, as they need to maintain conversation context throughout a potentially lengthy exchange. For best results when generating the final document drafts, consider using a low temperature setting (0.2-0.5) to encourage factual, focused output.

## How I designed these

I use AI tools for prompt design combined with my personal [Prompt Rulebook](https://promptquick.ai) and all the acquired metaknowledge throughout my journey of study and engineering.
